[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT3gYZM2AI)

- Ghost form uses the same bar as your pet actionbar,
  as such you keys will be whatever your pet bar keys are bound to.

- When dying to shadow of death you will become a ghost, and spawn 4 hostile ghosts that you have to kill
- Use Spirit Volley (no 5 on action bar), then use Spirit Chains (no 4 on action bar)
- Use Spirit Lance (no 3 on action bar) once on each target
- Repeat until all ghosts are dead
- If any other ghosts alive, kill them, then dps boss as the spirit pumps
